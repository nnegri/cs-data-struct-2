Discussion Questions

Recursion
1) Recursion is when a function calls itself.
2) A base case is necessary so the recursive calls end once the condition is met.

Graphs
1) A graph is a datastructure of nodes/vertices, connected by edges. It can
be either directed or undirected.
2) A graph's nodes can be connected in cycles, its edges can be weighted,
and do not have hierarchies. 
3) The water cycle can be represented by a graph.
